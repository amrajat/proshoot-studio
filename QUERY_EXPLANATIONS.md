# 🔍 Simple English Explanation of Supabase Queries

## What happens when you visit a studio detail page?

### 🎯 **STEP 1: Find the Studio**
**Query:** "Find the studio with this ID and tell me who created it"
```
Look in the 'studios' table
Find the row where id = 'your-studio-id'
Give me: name, status, creator, organization info
```
**What this means:** Like looking up a file in a filing cabinet to see who owns it.

---

### 🔒 **STEP 2: Security Check**
**Check:** "Is this person the one who created this studio?"
```
Compare: studio.creator_user_id === current_user_id
```
**What this means:** Like checking if you have the key to your own house.

---

### 🎨 **STEP 3A: If Studio Status = "COMPLETED"**
**Query:** "Show me all the watermarked preview images for this studio"
```
Look in the 'headshots' table
Find all rows where studio_id = 'your-studio-id'
Only get ones that have a 'preview' image
Give me: id, preview image URL, prompt, date created
```
**What this means:** Like looking at thumbnails in a photo gallery - you can see them but they have watermarks.

---

### ⭐ **STEP 3B: If Studio Status = "ACCEPTED"**

#### **Query 2B:** "Show me the high-quality images this user has marked as favorites"
```
Look in the 'favorites' table (what user liked)
Join with 'headshots' table (to get the actual images)
Find favorites where studio_id = 'your-studio-id' AND user_id = 'your-user-id'
Give me: favorite info + the actual high-quality images
```
**What this means:** Like looking at your "liked" photos in Instagram - only the ones you've hearted.

#### **Query 2C:** "Show me every high-quality image in this studio so user can add/remove favorites"
```
Look in the 'headshots' table
Find all rows where studio_id = 'your-studio-id'
Only get ones that have 'result' OR 'hd' images (not previews)
Give me: id, result image, HD image, prompt, date
```
**What this means:** Like seeing ALL photos in an album so you can decide which ones to like or unlike.

---

## 🎯 **Why Two Queries for ACCEPTED Status?**

1. **Query 2B (Favorites):** Shows what you've already liked ❤️
2. **Query 2C (All Images):** Shows everything available so you can like/unlike 🖼️

Think of it like:
- **Query 2B:** Your "Favorites" playlist
- **Query 2C:** The entire music library you can choose from
