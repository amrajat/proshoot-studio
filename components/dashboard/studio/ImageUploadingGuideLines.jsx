          Avoid using multiple similar photos from the same outfit, as the AI
          needs diverse samples to function properly. Using several similar

          The results of our AI Headshots depend on how well you choose your
          sample photos, so select them carefully and take your time to collect
          good photos.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do not upload photos with Instagram or TikTok filters, artistic
          editing, post-processing, AI-generated or any other artifacts. The AI
          will exaggerate any filters, creating an "Obvious AI-generated".

        <li>
          Existing professional headshots are great to use, as long as they
          don't have any filters or post-processing.
