# Development Session Summary

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Authentication & Sidebar Issues
**Problem**: Sidebar was showing on auth pages after logout
**Root Cause**: Session validation wasn't checking both user and session objects
**Solution**: Enhanced layout authentication logic and improved logout with hard refresh

### 2. Image Upload Path Structure
**Problem**: Images uploading to `user_id/filename.jpg` instead of `user_id/currentuuid/filename.jpg`
**Root Cause**: API route `sanitizeFileName` function was stripping forward slashes
**Solution**: Modified sanitization to handle paths by splitting, sanitizing parts separately, then rejoining

### 3. Focus Data JSON Upload Failure
**Problem**: `focus_data.json` file not uploading to bucket
**Root Cause**: Payment check was happening before JSON upload, causing early exit for users without credits
**Solution**: Moved focus_data.json upload before payment validation in execution flow

## Technical Fixes Applied

### API Route Improvements (`/api/r2/upload/route.js`)
- Added `application/json` to allowed content types
- Enhanced `sanitizeFileName` to preserve path structure
- Maintained security while supporting UUID folder organization

### Upload Flow Optimization (`image-upload-step.jsx`)
- Reordered execution: validate → upload JSON → check payment → continue/redirect
- Ensured focus_data.json uploads regardless of credit status
- Cleaned up debugging code for production readiness

### Authentication Enhancements (`layout.jsx`, `account-switcher.jsx`)
- Added session validation alongside user validation
- Implemented hard refresh on logout to clear cached data
- Fixed sidebar visibility logic for auth pages

## File Structure Confirmed
```
R2 Bucket:
└── user_id/
    └── studio_uuid/
        ├── image1.jpg
        ├── image2.jpg
        └── focus_data.json
```

## Key Learnings
1. **Execution Order Matters**: Critical operations should happen before conditional redirects
2. **Path Sanitization**: Security measures must account for legitimate path structures
3. **Session Management**: Proper cleanup requires both client and server-side validation
4. **Error Handling**: Silent failures can be debugged with strategic logging

## Code Quality
- Removed all debugging console.log statements
- Maintained clean, production-ready code
- Preserved error handling without verbose logging
- Ensured consistent code formatting

## Testing Verified
- Images upload to correct path structure
- Focus data JSON uploads successfully
- Authentication flow works properly
- Sidebar behavior is correct across all scenarios
