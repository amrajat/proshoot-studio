## âœ… COMPLETED: Headshots Table Merge (2025-07-21)

### Summary

Successfully merged `preview_headshots` and `result_headshots` tables into a single `headshots` table with `preview` and `result` columns.

### Changes Made

#### Database Schema

1. **20250101000302_headshots_tables.sql**:

   - Merged `preview_headshots` and `result_headshots` into single `headshots` table

   - Added constraint to ensure at least one image exists
   - Updated all indexes, constraints, and RLS policies
   - Updated `favorites` table foreign key to reference new `headshots` table

2. **20250101000303_studio_functions.sql**:
   - Updated `append_preview_image_urls()` to insert into `headshots` table with `preview` column
   - Updated `append_results_image_urls()` to update existing records with `result` column
